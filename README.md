# ABOUT ME PAGE 

For my `about me` page, I used various html tags and css styles to achieve the look that I wanted.

## HTML 

I used the following html tags in addition to the standard ones:

    - `<div>`
    - `<img>`
    - `<p>`
    - `<h2>`, `<h4>`
    - `<a>`
    - `<footer>`

I also used different `class`es and `id`s in order to style sections easier in css.
