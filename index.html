        <p class="about">Hi! I'm Stef.</p>

        <p class="about">I'm a photographer turned filmmaker turned coder, a lifelong maker and creator. When I am not coding, I'm most likely sewing, knitting or teaching my dog some kind of new tricks. I am a huge believer in always learning, so I am always trying to teach myself a new skill or try out a new DIY project.</p>

        <p class="about">I love to travel and was lucky enough to live abroad in England for two years while I studied film.</p>

        <p class="about">A random fact about me is that I am a champion barista! I have won two barista competitions thanks to my coffee crafting techniques. Nothing is better in the morning than a perfectly made cappuccino.</p>

        <p class="about">Since I love to do so many things, my goal is to find a way to meld all of my passions into a fulfilling career. One way will be to use my tech skills to help animal rescues. So... stay tuned!</p>

      <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://scottishrosemedia.com/photo/nature.html">Scotland</a></h2>

      <p>Scotland is one of my all time favorite places! It is so beautiful, the scenery is absolutely incredible and I love the weather. The highland games, cows and the sheep, gah! Love it! One day I will see old Nessie when I stop to admire the view at one of the lochs. (She totally has to exist! Right?!) They also have as much plaid as I could ever possibly want... I may have a mild plaid addiction! Plaid on all the things!! And the whisky! Travelling around to the distilleries to taste amazing whisky? Well, that is pretty rad too.</p>

      <p>I am also a certified dog trainer! A huge passion of mine is dogs, specifically rescue and ending puppy mills. Most of the problems that dogs in shelters have developed are from being mistreated by humans, whether that be from improper breeding or plain abuse, no dog's life should be cut short because of this. To learn more about puppy mills, please check out <a href="https://harleypuppymilldog.com/" target="_blank">Harley's page</a>.</p>

      <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://scottishrosemedia.com/photo/stills.html">Photography</a></h2>
      <img src="images/camera.jpg" alt="camera">
      <p>I love to take photos, especially of clouds! I have essentially had a camera, or more so a phone these days, in my hand since I was about 5 years old. I take pictures of everything. My love of photography crossed over into film when I was in my teens. Which then led me to pursue editing and screenwriting. I still work as a photographer and film editor when I can.</p>

      <img src="images/EarthyCircleScarf.jpg" alt="scarf">
      <p>Crafts. Where do I begin? Crafting is my livelihood! I love DIY projects. I mostly knit and sew and have a little shop on <a href="#">Etsy</a> where I sell some of my handmade goodies. I sew alot of my own clothes and knit scarves, blankets and hats for the cooler weather. I've also gotten pretty good at fair isle knitting, which I picked up when I lived abroad. My favorite thing to do for a friend or family memeber is make them a gift, it gives me such joy to share my creations! My current project is a line of DIY dog toys that I am selling to benefit dog rescues.</p>
